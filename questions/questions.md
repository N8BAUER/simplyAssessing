*Question 1*  

 
From: marissa@startup.com  
Subject:  Bad design  

Hello,  
  
Sorry to give you the kind of feedback that I know you do not want to hear, but I really hate the new dashboard design. Clearing and deleting indexes are now several clicks away. I am needing to use these features while iterating, so this is inconvenient.  
   
Thanks,  
Marissa

Hi Marissa, 

Actually, I appreciate the candid feedback on the new dashboard design. I'm sorry that you're finding it inconvenient. Initially, I was having the exact same reaction to the change as well, but I've found a few optimizations with the new dashboard that I think will brighten your day. What's your availability this week for a 15-30 minute tutorial?


Best Regards,

*Question 2*:   
  
From: carrie@coffee.com  
Subject: URGENT ISSUE WITH PRODUCTION!!!!  
  
Since today 9:15am we have been seeing a lot of errors on our website. Multiple users have reported that they were unable to publish their feedbacks and that an alert box with "Record is too big, please contact enterprise@algolia.com".  
  
Our website is an imdb like website where users can post reviews of coffee shops online. Along with that we enrich every record with a lot of metadata that is not for search. I am already a paying customer of your service, what else do you need to make your search work?  
  
Please advise on how to fix this. Thanks.

Hi Carrie, 

I'm terribly sorry to hear that you're having a production issue! 

The error that you're encountering is more than likely being caused by the record size of the feedback forms. Algolia, limits record size for performance reasons. I'll take a look at your account to see what your plan allows. Also, since this is a production error I'm able to get on a call to troubleshoot the exact issue if you're available now? 

Best Regards, 

Nate Bauer

Hi, my website is not working and here's the error:  
  
![error message](./error.png)  
  
Can you fix it please?  

Response: 

Hi Marc, 

SerachKit is an open source library. It's possible that the package isn't installed or being imported correctly. However, it's not an Algolia product so I don't believe we provide an integration or direct support. That being said I'll check with my colleagues here today so I can point you in the right direction.

Best Regards, 

Nate Bauer
